 Code for animation and sound

 The code for these animations primarily uses Lua and GLSL. Among them, Animation (1) is the code used for the final ending of the animation, while the rest are different individual effects. The main code can be found in the Xshader files in different directories. Lua is the plug-in language used for video editing software.
