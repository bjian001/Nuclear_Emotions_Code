 Code for animation and sound

The code for these animations primarily uses Lua and GLSL. These are all the animations used in the final videos. Among them, Animation (1) is the code used for the final ending of the animation, while the rest are different individual effects used for different elements in the whole canvas. The main shaders' code can be found in the Xshader files in different directories. Lua is used as the language for video editing software because it's lightweight.
